# PlugableApp

This project surge as a solution to a problem I found in serveral companies I've been working as a developer. Nowadays there is every kind of solution for every kind of problems out there. In my case, I have a long time looking for a solution that includes a package manager that includes Packaging, Updating, Distributing, Integrating, Installing, but also a simple modular application using this package manager. Going further, the final idea of this project is to create an application to install their own packages (plugins) using a nuget package server and the previously discussed solution.

Seems like there is too much information in one paragraph. Well, that's why i came up with the following diagram in order to let you know the idea in more detail:
