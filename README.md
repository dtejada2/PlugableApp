# PlugableApp

This is a c# complete modular application solution built with the goal of manage your application on independent parts. In order to accomplishe this goal the solution include Packaging, Updating, Distributing, Integrating and Installing. Which means that the application can install their own packages (plugins) using a nuget package server.

This project surge as a solution to a problem I found in serveral companies I've been working as a developer. Nowadays there is every kind of solution for every kind of problems out there. In my case, I have a long time looking for a solution that includes a package manager solution.

Seems like there is too much information in one paragraph. Well, that's why i came up with the following diagram in order to let you know the idea in more detail:
